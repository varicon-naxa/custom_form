# Image Editor and Loading Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Image Editor Applied to Gallery Images** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Gallery images were unnecessarily going through the image editor, which was causing delays and user confusion.

**Solution**: Modified the image processing logic to only apply the image editor to camera images.

**Code Changes**:
```dart
// Before: All images went through editor
if (widget.customPainter != null) {
  // Editor applied to all images
}

// After: Only camera images go through editor
if (source == ImageSource.camera && widget.customPainter != null) {
  // Editor applied only to camera images
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/src/form_elements/optimized_image_picker.dart`

### 2. **Infinite Loading State** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Images were showing a loading overlay indefinitely because the upload status wasn't being properly updated.

**Solution**: 
1. Added proper upload status tracking
2. Updated loading overlay logic to only show for newly added images
3. Added methods to update upload status after successful upload

**Code Changes**:

#### A. Upload Status Update
```dart
// After upload, update status
final uploadResult = await widget.onImagesSelected(processedImages);

if (uploadResult != null && uploadResult.isNotEmpty) {
  // Mark images as uploaded
  final updatedImages = processedImages.map((img) => 
    img.copyWith(isUploaded: true)
  ).toList();
  
  // Update state with uploaded status
  ref
      .read(simpleImagePickerProvider(widget.fieldId).notifier)
      .updateImagesWithUploadStatus(processedImages, updatedImages);
}
```

#### B. Loading Overlay Logic
```dart
// Before: Show loading for all non-uploaded images
if (image.isUploaded == false) _buildLoadingOverlay()

// After: Show loading only for newly added images
if (image.isUploaded == false && image.id == null) _buildLoadingOverlay()
```

#### C. Remove Button Logic
```dart
// Before: Only show remove button for uploaded images
if (image.isUploaded ?? false) _buildRemoveButton(image)

// After: Show remove button for all images
_buildRemoveButton(image)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/src/form_elements/optimized_image_picker.dart`
- `lib/src/state/attachment_provider.dart` (added `updateImagesWithUploadStatus`)

### 3. **File Picker Upload Status** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Files also had the same upload status tracking issue.

**Solution**: Applied the same upload status tracking logic to file picker.

**Code Changes**:
```dart
// After upload, update status
final uploadResult = await widget.onFilesSelected(processedFiles);

if (uploadResult != null && uploadResult.isNotEmpty) {
  // Mark files as uploaded
  final updatedFiles = processedFiles.map((file) => 
    file.copyWith(isUploaded: true)
  ).toList();
  
  // Update state with uploaded status
  ref
      .read(simpleFilePickerProvider(widget.fieldId).notifier)
      .updateFilesWithUploadStatus(processedFiles, updatedFiles);
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/src/form_elements/optimized_file_picker.dart`
- `lib/src/state/attachment_provider.dart` (added `updateFilesWithUploadStatus`)

## Benefits

## Testing

### **Image Editor Test**
1. Select "Camera" → Image should go through editor
2. Select "Gallery" → Image should NOT go through editor
3. Verify gallery images load faster

### **Loading State Test**
1. Add new images/files → Should show loading briefly
2. After upload completes → Loading should disappear
3. Existing images/files → Should not show loading

### **Remove Button Test**
1. New images/files → Should have remove button
2. Uploaded images/files → Should have remove button
3. Verify remove functionality works for all items
